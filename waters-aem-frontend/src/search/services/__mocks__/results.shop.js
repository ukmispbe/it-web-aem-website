Links are also provided to articles for more in-depth reading. The first section examines who uses mass spectrometers, followed by how compounds are ionized in the source to be analyzed by mass spectrometers. A description of the various types of mass spectrometers is followed by a discussion of the important topics of mass accuracy and resolution — or how well we can tell differences between closely related compounds. Chemistry, sample prep, and data handling are considered, as well as the definition of some terms commonly used in the most prevalent forms of MS practice today.",

        "description": "As the interest in peptides as potential drug candidates continues to grow the need for basic information about the isolation and purification of these peptides also grows. Whether peptides are made step-wise using solid-phase peptide synthesis, solution phase synthesis, or isolated from naturally-occurring sources, almost all crude peptide mixtures are complex and require purification. The Practical Approaches to Peptide Isolation, a 84 page book, discusses the peptide isolation workflow, method development considerations including column selection, choice of mobile-phase modifier, the use of temperature, and gradient optimization, along with other relevant topics.  The use of mass-directed isolation which makes the purification process easier with less ambiguous discrimination between the target peptide and the contaminants is also discussed.",
